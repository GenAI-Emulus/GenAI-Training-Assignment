# Generative AI Training Assignment Repository
Welcome to the Generative AI Training Assignment repository at Emulus!

This repository provides the code, data, and documentation for your Generative AI training assignment.

## What's included:

- Training scripts: Python scripts are used to train the generative AI model.
- Data: The dataset used for training the model. This may include text, images, code, or other relevant data.
- Evaluation notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
- Documentation: This README file explains the project setup, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- Additional resources: Any other relevant files such as configuration files, pre-trained models, or visualization tools.

## Goals:

The goal of this assignment is to:

- Gain hands-on experience with training generative AI models.
- Explore different generative AI techniques and architectures.
- Apply generative AI to a specific task or domain.
- Evaluate the performance of the trained model and identify areas for improvement.

## Contributing:

This repository is open for further development and exploration of generative AI techniques. We encourage you to contribute by:

- Adding new training scripts for different generative AI models.
- Expanding the dataset with additional data relevant to your specific task.
- Creating new evaluation notebooks to measure different aspects of model performance.
- Sharing your findings and improvements in the documentation.
